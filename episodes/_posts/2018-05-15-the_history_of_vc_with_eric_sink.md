Edward and Martin talk with their old boss
[Eric Sink](https://ericsink.com/) about the history of version control
as he's seen it - and helped create it.  Eric founded
[SourceGear](https://sourcegear.com/), a company that created several
version control products, and literally wrote the book on version control,
[Version Control by Example](http://ericsink.com/vcbe/).

In his own words:

> Eric's work in version control tools includes SourceGear Vault, which
> was quite popular in the early days of .NET, and Veracity, which was
> one of the open source DVCS tools that got crushed by Git.  SourceGear
> today has pivoted to become a 12-step recovery program for people
> addicted to writing version control tools.
