Edward and Martin talk with [Joe Nash](https://twitter.com/jna_sh)

and using pull requests in non-development workflows.

> Joe is the student program manager at GitHub, where his work aims to
> help student leaders build inclusive learning communities. When not
> capitalising the H in GitHub, Joe can usually be found talking about
> the educational benefits of hackathons, or rolling d20s.

* [David Newbury](https://twitter.com/workergnome/status/984216505045757952) on Git concepts:
  > Git reminds me of some academic concepts. You can teach it, but It only really makes sense if you know the history of what came before and have worked at a level of complexity where you NEED it. Once you get there it changes your worldview but explaining why thatâ€™s so is SO hard.
