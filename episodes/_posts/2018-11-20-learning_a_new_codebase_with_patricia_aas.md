Edward talks to Patricia Aas, a veteran C++ developer, about how
read a brand new codebase, understand it, and how to get started 
contributing to it.

> [Patricia Aas](https://patricia.no) is a programmer who has worked mostly
> in C++ and Java. She has spent her career continuously delivering from the
> same code-base to a large user base, from working on two browsers (Opera
> and Vivaldi), to working on embedded telepresence endpoints for Cisco.
> She is focused on the maintainability and flexibility of software
> architecture, and how to extend it to provide cutting edge user
> experiences. Her focus on the end users has led her work more and more
> toward privacy and security, and she has recently started her own company,
> [TurtleSec](https://turtlesec.no), hoping to contribute positively to the
> infosec and C++ communities. She is also involved in the
> [#include&lt;C++&gt;](https://www.includecpp.org) organization hoping to
> improve diversity and inclusion in the C++ community.
