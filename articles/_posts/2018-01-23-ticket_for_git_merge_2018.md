All Things Git is very excited about the upcoming [Git Merge
2018](https://git-merge.com/) conference.  Git Merge is an event
dedicated to the Git version control system, and it's _the_ conference
for the Git community.

To encourage more people to be active in the Git community, especially
people from diverse backgrounds, Edward and Martin are giving away
a ticket to the conference to a woman, person of color, or member of
another group often underrepresented in software development and tech
conferences.

We'll be choosing an entrant at random in February.  To sign up for
the drawing, please <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/PXWYYbWPS7RXT9Pv2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fill out this form</a>.

(Sorry, we cannot provide travel or lodging:  the podcast does not have
any sponsors, so this is being provided directly by Edward and Martin.)

Good luck, and we hope to see you at Git Merge!
